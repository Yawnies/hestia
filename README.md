# Hestia
A JS-heavy project that I made using more advanced DOM techs. It stores logs with a few information bits that contain what the user writes and displays them on a list where you have the option to read and delete them.  
  
It also comes with a sample log that contains some lore about a far-away planet in a distant future. Hope you enjoy!
